Currently, Indonesia is undaunted by development in all fields. One of Indonesia's development priorities contained in the Nawacita is to build Indonesia from the periphery by strengthening regions and villages within the framework of a unitary state. Village development is an effort to improve rural communities quality of life and welfare. This village development serves as a manifestation of the implementation of Law No. 6 of 2014 concerning Villages, especially in Article 74 concerning Village Development Needs and Article 78 concerning Village Development Goals. Therefore, the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) conducts data collection on village potentials every four years to determine the availability of infrastructure, social and economic potential owned by the administration at the village/kelurahan, sub-district, district/city level throughout Indonesia and to determine the development index of an area. 

Based on the data collection on village potential, it was found that the island with the highest Village Development Index (IPD) in 2018 was Java-Bali Island, with an IPD of 67.82. The second highest IPD achievement was 60.63, which was achieved by Sulawesi Island, followed by Sumatra Island, with an IPD of 60.02 as the third position. The three islands have an IPD above the national IPD average of 59.36, while the other four islands, such as Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and Papua, are still below the national IPD. The various IPD achievement values are calculated from five dimensions: Basic Services, Infrastructure Conditions, Accessibility/Transportation of Public Services, and Government Administration.
