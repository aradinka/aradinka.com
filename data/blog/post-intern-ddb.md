## Overview

In my last year of college, I interned as a data scientist in the technical voice analytics team (big data analytics & cyber security division) and the technical ai group (emerging technology platform division) in DDB Telkom. My team consists of less than eight people, with two interns. I do all data scientist activities starting from paper research, reproducing SOTA paper code from GitHub, reading old code, implementing new code on the server, doing model training, evaluating model performance, creating CRUD API, writing papers, and creating datasets for evaluation.

Some projects that I work on use voice data and text data. On text data, I researched question-answering systems and conducted big language training on the Indonesian RoBERTa model using the Indo4B dataset by utilizing several GPUs on the server. On voice data, I created a speaker diarization project that includes voice activity detection, speaker recognition, and voice identification tasks.

## How I get in

![Interview](/static/gifs/post-intern-ddb.gif)

I registered at [internship.ddbtelkom.id/](https://internship.ddbtelkom.id/) as a data scientist. This FHCI program allows active students to do an internship for six months which can be extended for up to 12 months. My CV was accepted, and I had to make a profile video like the one above. After my application was received, I was interviewed by 2 data scientists from Telkom about the projects I had worked on and the stack of data science tools I could use.

## Projects

### Speaker Diarization

> Given a speaker recognition model, how do we know how many speakers there are in audio and when the speaker speaks?

This project is also the initiation of my final undergraduate thesis project, which is about unsupervised speaker diarization. A demo of my final project can be seen **[here](https://aradinka-xview2-building-damage-detection-app-rm3i5q.streamlit.app/)**.
