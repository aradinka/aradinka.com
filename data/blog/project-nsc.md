On September 25, 2015, world leaders officially endorsed the Sustainable Development Goals agenda as a global development agreement. The SDGs contain 17 Goals and 169 Targets, which are a global action plan for the next 15 years (from 2016 to 2030), where one of the goals is about the quality of education.

In 2017/2018 in Indonesia, there were 218,562 schools (76.08% public and 23.92% private) with a total of 45,192,901 students and 2,752,616 teachers. Based on the Education Index released by the Human Development Reports (2018), Indonesia is in the seventh position in ASEAN with a score of 0.625. The highest score was achieved by Singapore (0.837), and the lowest was achieved by Myanmar (0.452). The Education Index (EI) is calculated based on the average and expected length of schooling. Therefore, EI correlates with the length of the school taken, which is 97.5%, while the correlation between EI and school expectations is 94.5%. From 2015 to 2018, the average schooling length in Indonesia increased yearly until, in 2018, the average length of schooling reached 8.58 years. Unfortunately, the average number of years of schooling in 2018 has not met the Kemendikbud Strategic Plan target of 8.7 years. The province in Indonesia with the highest average length of schooling is DKI Jakarta (11.06), while the lowest is Papua (6.66 years).

Indonesia is ranked 67th out of 125 countries in the world in the 2019 GTCI ranking. This shows that the competitiveness of Indonesian Human Resources is still inferior to other countries. One way to increase competitiveness is to improve the quality of education in Indonesia. Various efforts from all elements of society are moving to advance Indonesian education, including the Indonesian youth who are moved to create educational startups as follows:
- Ruang Guru, founded by Belva Devara and Iman Usman (2014)
- Zenius Education, founded by Wisnu OPS (2007)
- IndonesiaX, founded by Lucy Pandjaitan (2015)
