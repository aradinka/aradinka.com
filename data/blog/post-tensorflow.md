TensorFlow is an open-source numerical computing framework whichs allows you to build and deploy your models (run your model on-device, in the browser, or in the cloud). TensorFlow issued its official certificate. This certificate is intended as a foundational certificate for students, developers, and data scientists who want to demonstrate practical machine learning skills by building and training models using TensorFlow.
