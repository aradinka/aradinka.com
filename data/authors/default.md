Hi. I’m Azka!

I’m a statistics fresh graduate from Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology with 1-year data science internship experience in the technical AI team DDB Telkom Indonesia and 1-year experience as a computing lab assistant teaching data analytics course. 

My undergraduate thesis is about speaker diarization. In 2021, I graduate from Google Bangkit and getting my TensorFlow Developer Certificate. I have a hobby in photography and design.
